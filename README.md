# Python-TKINTER-GUI-PDF-Merged-Project
Here I make a GUI using Python Tkinter to merge PDFs from a particular folder .
Here i create two file named : "GUI.py" and "tkinter_function.py"
In "GUI.py" it is used to create GUI where in "tkinter_function.py" is used to apply logic .
It shows two listbox. 1st listbox is used for showing all pdf files from a folder that is given by the user.
and 2nd listbox shows Merged PDF and it's location where it is saved.
